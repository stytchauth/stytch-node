  /**
   * This endpoint allows you to exchange the `intermediate_session_token` returned when the user
   * successfully completes a Discovery authentication flow to create a new
   * [Organization](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/organization-object) and
   * [Member](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/member-object) and log the user in. If the user wants to log
   * into an existing Organization, use the
   * [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session)
   * instead.
   *
   * Stytch **requires that users verify their email address** prior to creating a new Organization in order
   * to prevent Account Takeover (ATO) attacks and phishing.
   *
   * If the user authenticated using a method that **does not** provide real-time email verification
   * (returning password auth, Github/Slack/Hubspot OAuth) this API will return `member_authenticated: false`
   * and an `intermediate_session_token` to indicate that the user must perform additional authentication via
   * one of the options listed in `primary_required.allowed_auth_methods` to finish logging in.
   *
   * If you specified an `mfa_policy: REQUIRED_FOR_ALL` in the request, this API will return
   * `member_authenticated: false`, an `intermediate_session_token`, and `mfa_required` in order to indicate
   * that you must prompt the user to enroll in MFA.
   *
   * Include the `intermediate_session_token` when calling the `authenticate()` method that the user needed
   * to perform to verify their email or enroll in MFA. Once the user has completed the authentication
   * requirements they were missing, they will be granted a full `session_token` and `session_jwt` and be
   * successfully logged in.
   *
   * If the user logged in with a method that **does** provide real-time email verification (Email Magic
   * Links, Email OTP, Google/Microsoft OAuth, initial email verification when creating a new password) this
   * API will return `member_authenticated: true` and a `session_jwt` and `session_token` to indicate that
   * the user has successfully logged in.
   *
   * The Member created by this endpoint will automatically be granted the `stytch_admin` Role. See the
   * [RBAC guide](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/rbac/stytch-default) for more details on this Role.

   * List all possible organization relationships connected to a

   * will be returned, and any membership can be assumed by calling the
