  /**
   * Send a One-Time Passcode (OTP) to a Member's phone number.
   *
   * If the Member already has a phone number, the `mfa_phone_number` field is not needed; the endpoint will
   * send an OTP to the number associated with the Member.
   * If the Member does not have a phone number, the endpoint will send an OTP to the `mfa_phone_number`
   * provided and link the `mfa_phone_number` with the Member.
   *
   * An error will be thrown if the Member already has a phone number and the provided `mfa_phone_number`
   * does not match the existing one.
   *
   * Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.
   *
   * If a Member has a phone number and is enrolled in MFA, then after a successful primary authentication
   * event (e.g. [email magic link](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link) or
   * [SSO](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/sso-authenticate) login is complete), an SMS OTP will
   * automatically be sent to their phone number. In that case, this endpoint should only be used for
   * subsequent authentication events, such as prompting a Member for an OTP again after a period of
   * inactivity.
   *
   * ### Cost to send SMS OTP
   * Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch
   * [bills the costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how to protect your
   * app against [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).
   *
   * __Note:__ SMS to phone numbers outside of the US and Canada is disabled by default for customers who did
   * not use SMS prior to October 2023. If you're interested in sending international SMS, please reach out
   * to [support@stytch.com](mailto:support@stytch.com?subject=Enable%20international%20SMS).

  /**
   * SMS OTPs may not be used as a primary authentication mechanism. They can be used to complete an MFA
   * requirement, or they can be used as a step-up factor to be added to an existing session.
   *
   * This endpoint verifies that the one-time passcode (OTP) is valid and hasn't expired or been previously
   * used. A given Member may only have a single active OTP code at any given time. If a Member requests
   * another OTP code before the first one has expired, the first one will be invalidated.
   *
   * Exactly one of `intermediate_session_token`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` must be provided in the
   * request.
   * If an intermediate session token is provided, this operation will consume it.
   *
   * Intermediate session tokens are generated upon successful calls to primary authenticate methods in the
   * case where MFA is required,
   * such as [email magic link authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link),
   * or upon successful calls to discovery authenticate methods, such as
   * [email magic link discovery authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-discovery-magic-link).
   *
   * If the Organization's MFA policy is `REQUIRED_FOR_ALL`, a successful OTP authentication will change the
   * Member's `mfa_enrolled` status to `true` if it is not already `true`.
   * If the Organization's MFA policy is `OPTIONAL`, the Member's MFA enrollment can be toggled by passing in
   * a value for the `set_mfa_enrollment` field.
   * The Member's MFA enrollment can also be toggled through the
   * [Update Member](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/update-member) endpoint.
   *
   * Provide the `session_duration_minutes` parameter to set the lifetime of the session. If the
   * `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a duration
   * of 60 minutes.
