  /**
   * This API allows you to check whether the user’s provided password is valid, and to provide feedback to
   * the user on how to increase the strength of their password.
   *
   * This endpoint adapts to your Project's password strength configuration. If you're using
   * [zxcvbn](https://stytch.com/docs/passwords#strength-requirements), the default, your passwords are
   * considered valid if the strength score is >= 3. If you're using
   * [LUDS](https://stytch.com/docs/passwords#strength-requirements), your passwords are considered valid if
   * they meet the requirements that you've set with Stytch. You may update your password strength
   * configuration in the [stytch dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/password-strength-config).
   *
   * ## Password feedback
   * The zxcvbn_feedback and luds_feedback objects contains relevant fields for you to relay feedback to
   * users that failed to create a strong enough password.
   *
   * If you're using [zxcvbn](https://stytch.com/docs/passwords#strength-requirements), the feedback object
   * will contain warning and suggestions for any password that does not meet the
   * [zxcvbn](https://stytch.com/docs/passwords#strength-requirements) strength requirements. You can return
   * these strings directly to the user to help them craft a strong password.
   *
   * If you're using [LUDS](https://stytch.com/docs/passwords#strength-requirements), the feedback object
   * will contain a collection of fields that the user failed or passed. You'll want to prompt the user to
   * create a password that meets all requirements that they failed.

   * Authenticate a member with their email address and password. This endpoint verifies that the member has
   * a password currently set, and that the entered password is correct. There are two instances where the
   * endpoint will return a reset_password error even if they enter their previous password:
   * * The member’s credentials appeared in the HaveIBeenPwned dataset.
   *     * We force a password reset to ensure that the member is the legitimate owner of the email address,
   * and not a malicious actor abusing the compromised credentials.
   * * A member that has previously authenticated with email/password uses a passwordless authentication
   * method tied to the same email address (e.g. Magic Links) for the first time. Any subsequent
   * email/password authentication attempt will result in this error.
   *     * We force a password reset in this instance in order to safely deduplicate the account by email
   * address, without introducing the risk of a pre-hijack account takeover attack.
   *     * Imagine a bad actor creates many accounts using passwords and the known email addresses of their
   * victims. If a victim comes to the site and logs in for the first time with an email-based passwordless
   * authentication method then both the victim and the bad actor have credentials to access to the same
   * account. To prevent this, any further email/password login attempts first require a password reset which
   * can only be accomplished by someone with access to the underlying email address.
