   * Authenticate an email/password combination in the discovery flow. This authenticate flow is only valid
   * for cross-org passwords use cases, and is not tied to a specific organization.
   *
   * If you have breach detection during authentication enabled in your
   * [password strength policy](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/passwords/strength-policies) and the
   * member's credentials have appeared in the HaveIBeenPwned dataset, this endpoint will return a
   * `member_reset_password` error even if the member enters a correct password. We force a password reset in
   * this case to ensure that the member is the legitimate owner of the email address and not a malicious
   * actor abusing the compromised credentials.
   *
   * If successful, this endpoint will create a new intermediate session and return a list of discovered
   * organizations that can be session exchanged into.
