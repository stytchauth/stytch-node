   * valid, hasnâ€™t expired, or already been used.
   *
   * The provided password needs to meet our password strength requirements, which can be checked in advance
   * with the password strength endpoint. If the token and password are accepted, the password is securely
   * stored for future authentication and the user is authenticated.
   *
   * If the Member is required to complete MFA to log in to the Organization, the returned value of
   * `member_authenticated` will be `false`, and an `intermediate_session_token` will be returned.
   * The `intermediate_session_token` can be passed into the
   * [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete the
   * MFA step and acquire a full member session.
   * The `session_duration_minutes` and `session_custom_claims` parameters will be ignored.
   *
   * If a valid `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed in, the Member will not be required to complete an
   * MFA step.
