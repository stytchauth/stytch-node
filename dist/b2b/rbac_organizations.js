   *
   * The organization RBAC policy feature is currently in private beta and must be enabled for your
   * Workspace. Please contact Stytch support at support@stytch.com to request access.
   *
   * Get the active RBAC Policy for a specific Organization within your Stytch Project. An Organization RBAC
   * Policy contains the roles that have been defined specifically for that organization, allowing for
   * organization-specific permissioning models.
   *
   * This endpoint returns the organization-scoped roles that supplement the project-level RBAC policy.
   * Organization policies allow you to define custom roles that are specific to individual organizations
   * within your project.
   *
   * When using the backend SDKs, the RBAC Policy will be cached to allow for local evaluations, eliminating
   * the need for an extra request to Stytch. The policy will be refreshed if an authorization check is
   * requested and the RBAC policy was last updated more than 5 minutes ago.
   *
   * Organization-specific roles can be created and managed through this API endpoint, providing fine-grained
   * control over permissions at the organization level.
   *
   * Check out the [RBAC overview](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/rbac/overview) to learn more about
   * Stytch's RBAC permissioning model and organization-scoped policies.

   * Set the RBAC Policy for a specific Organization within your Stytch Project. An Organization RBAC Policy
   * allows you to define roles that are specific to that organization, providing fine-grained control over
   * permissions at the organization level.
   *
   * This endpoint allows you to create, update, or replace the organization-scoped roles for a given
   * organization. Organization policies supplement the project-level RBAC policy with additional roles that
   * are only applicable within the context of that specific organization.
   *
   * The organization policy consists of roles, where each role defines:
   * - A unique `role_id` to identify the role
   * - A human-readable `description` of the role's purpose
   * - A set of `permissions` that specify which actions can be performed on which resources
   *
   * When you set an organization policy, it will replace any existing organization-specific roles for that
   * organization. The project-level RBAC policy remains unchanged.
   *
   * Organization-specific roles are useful for scenarios where different organizations within your project
   * require different permission structures, such as:
   * - Multi-tenant applications with varying access levels per tenant
   * - Organizations with custom approval workflows
   * - Different organizational hierarchies requiring unique role definitions
   *
