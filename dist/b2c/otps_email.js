   * Send a one-time passcode (OTP) to a User using their email. If you'd like to create a user and send them
   * a passcode with one request, use our
   * [log in or create endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/api/log-in-or-create-user-by-email-otp).
   *
   * ### Add an email to an existing user
   * This endpoint also allows you to add a new email to an existing Stytch User. Including a `user_id`,
   * `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in the request will add the email to the pre-existing Stytch User upon
   * successful authentication.
   *
   * Adding a new email to an existing Stytch User requires the User to be present and validate the email via
   * OTP. This requirement is in place to prevent account takeover attacks.
   *
   * ### Next steps
   * Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call
   * [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp) using the OTP `code` along with the
   * `phone_id` found in the response as the `method_id`.
