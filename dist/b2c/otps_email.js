  /**
   * Send a One-Time Passcode (OTP) to a User using their email. If you'd like to create a user and send them
   * a passcode with one request, use our
   * [log in or create endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/api/log-in-or-create-user-by-email-otp).
   *
   * ### Add an email to an existing user
   * This endpoint also allows you to add a new email address to an existing Stytch User. Including a
   * `user_id`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in your Send one-time passcode by email request will add
   * the new, unverified email address to the existing Stytch User. If the user successfully authenticates
   * within 5 minutes, the new email address will be marked as verified and remain permanently on the
   * existing Stytch User. Otherwise, it will be removed from the User object, and any subsequent login
   * requests using that email address will create a new User.
   *
   * ### Next steps
   * Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call
   * [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp) using the OTP `code` along with the
   * `phone_id` found in the response as the `method_id`.
   * @param data {@link OTPsEmailSendRequest}
   * @returns {@link OTPsEmailSendResponse}
   * @async
   * @throws A {@link StytchError} on a non-2xx response from the Stytch API
   * @throws A {@link RequestError} when the Stytch API cannot be reached
