   * Send a one-time passcode (OTP) to a user's phone number. If you'd like to create a user and send them a
   * passcode with one request, use our
   * [log in or create](https://stytch.com/docs/api/log-in-or-create-user-by-sms) endpoint.
   *
   * Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.
   *
   * ### Add a phone number to an existing user
   *
   * This endpoint also allows you to add a new phone number to an existing Stytch User. Including a
   * `user_id`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in the request will add the phone number to the
   * pre-existing Stytch User upon successful authentication.
   *
   * Adding a new phone number to an existing Stytch User requires the user to be present and validate the
   * phone number via OTP. This requirement is in place to prevent account takeover attacks.
   *
   * ### Next steps
   *
   * Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call
   * [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp) using the OTP `code` along with the
   * `phone_id` found in the response as the `method_id`.
