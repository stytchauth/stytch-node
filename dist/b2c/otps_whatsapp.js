  /**
   * Send a One-Time Passcode (OTP) to a User's WhatsApp. If you'd like to create a user and send them a
   * passcode with one request, use our
   * [log in or create](https://stytch.com/docs/api/whatsapp-login-or-create) endpoint.
   *
   * Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.
   *
   * ### Cost to send SMS OTP
   * Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch
   * [bills the costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how to protect your
   * app against [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).
   *
   * ### Add a phone number to an existing user
   *
   * This endpoint also allows you to add a new phone number to an existing Stytch User. Including a
   * `user_id`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in your Send one-time passcode by WhatsApp request will add
   * the new, unverified phone number to the existing Stytch User. If the user successfully authenticates
   * within 5 minutes, the new phone number will be marked as verified and remain permanently on the existing
   * Stytch User. Otherwise, it will be removed from the User object, and any subsequent login requests using
   * that phone number will create a new User.
   *
   * ### Next steps
   *
   * Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call
   * [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp) using the OTP `code` along with the
   * `phone_id` found in the response as the `method_id`.
