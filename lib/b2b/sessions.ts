   * and target Member have the same phone number and the phone number is verified for both Members.
   *
   * If the Member is required to complete MFA to log in to the Organization, the returned value of
   * `member_authenticated` will be `false`, and an `intermediate_session_token` will be returned.
   * The `intermediate_session_token` can be passed into the
   * [OTP SMS Authenticate endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete the
   * MFA step and acquire a full member session.
   * The `intermediate_session_token` can also be used with the
   * [Exchange Intermediate Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session)
   * or the
   * [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery) to join a different Organization or create a new one.

   *
   * JWTs have a set lifetime of 5 minutes, so there will be a 5 minute period where some JWTs will be signed
   * by the old JWKS, and some JWTs will be signed by the new JWKS. The correct JWKS to use for validation is
   * determined by matching the `kid` value of the JWT and JWKS.

   * If you're using your own JWT validation library, many have built-in support for JWKS rotation, and

   * for validation by inspecting the `kid` value.
