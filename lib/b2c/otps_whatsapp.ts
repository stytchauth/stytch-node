  /**
  * Send a One-Time Passcode (OTP) to a User's WhatsApp. If you'd like to create a user and send them a
  * passcode with one request, use our
  * [log in or create](https://stytch.com/docs/api/whatsapp-login-or-create) endpoint.
  * 
  * Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.
  * 
  * ### Cost to send SMS OTP
  * Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch
  * [bills the costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how to protect your
  * app against [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).
  * 
  * ### Add a phone number to an existing user
  * 
  * This endpoint also allows you to add a new phone number to an existing Stytch User. Including a
  * `user_id`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in your Send one-time passcode by WhatsApp request will add
  * the new, unverified phone number to the existing Stytch User. If the user successfully authenticates
  * within 5 minutes, the new phone number will be marked as verified and remain permanently on the existing
  * Stytch User. Otherwise, it will be removed from the User object, and any subsequent login requests using
  * that phone number will create a new User.
  * 
  * ### Next steps
  * 
  * Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call
  * [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp) using the OTP `code` along with the
  * `phone_id` found in the response as the `method_id`.
  * @param data {@link OTPsWhatsappSendRequest}
  * @returns {@link OTPsWhatsappSendResponse}
  * @async
  * @throws A {@link StytchError} on a non-2xx response from the Stytch API
  * @throws A {@link RequestError} when the Stytch API cannot be reached
