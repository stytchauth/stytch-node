# Stytch example: Modules

This directory contains some examples for using `stytch` as an ES6 module.

The examples use the test environment and will look for `PROJECT_ID` and `SECRET` environment
variables to use for calling the API. You can find these values in your [Stytch
dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys).
